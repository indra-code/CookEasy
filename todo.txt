    SELECT
        i.ingredient_id,
        CASE
            WHEN NEW.weight IS NULL THEN i.weight
            WHEN NEW.unit = i.unit THEN i.weight - NEW.weight
            WHEN i.unit = 'kg' AND NEW.unit = 'g' AND (i.weight - (NEW.weight / 1000)) > 1 THEN i.weight - (NEW.weight / 1000)
            WHEN i.unit = 'kg' AND NEW.unit = 'g' AND (i.weight - (NEW.weight / 1000)) < 1 THEN (i.weight - (NEW.weight / 1000)) * 1000
            ELSE i.weight
        END AS weight,
        CASE
            WHEN i.unit = 'kg' AND NEW.unit = 'g' AND (i.weight - (NEW.weight / 1000)) < 1 THEN 'g'
            ELSE i.unit
        END AS unit
    FROM ingredients i
    WHERE i.ingredient_id = NEW.ingredient_id
    AND (NEW.weight IS NULL OR NEW.weight < i.weight);
END
